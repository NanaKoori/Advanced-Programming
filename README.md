# Advanced-Programming (Haskell & Erlang)

This is the set of assignments for UCPU Advanced Programming course 2022. The main purpose of the project is to manage assignments. If some classmates are lucky enough to find our project on GitHub, please do not completely copy our code. Of course, you are welcome to refer to our ideas.

## Completion

### Assignment 1

| Question No.                      | Function Name | Completion (○/△/×) |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |:------------------ |
| Printing expressions              | showExp       | ○                  |
| Evaluating expressions            | evalSimple    | ○                  |
| Extended arithmetic expressions   | extendEnv     | ○                  |
| Extended arithmetic expressions   | evalFull      | ○                  |
| Returning explicit errors         | evalErr       | ○                  |
| Printing with minimal parentheses | showCompact   | ×                  |
| Explicitly eager/lazy semantics   | evalEager     | ×                  |
| Explicitly eager/lazy semantics   | evalLazy      | ×                  |

**Note:** The last three functions are optional and we haven't done it.

### Assignment 2

| Question No.          | Function Name | Completion (○/△/×) |
| --------------------- | ------------- |:------------------ |
| Monad operations      | abort         | ○                  |
| Monad operations      | look          | ○                  |
| Monad operations      | withBinding   | ○                  |
| Monad operations      | output        | ○                  |
| Auxilary functions    | truthy        | ○                  |
| Auxilary functions    | operate       | ○                  |
| Auxilary functions    | apply         | ○                  |
| Interpreter functions | eval          | △                  |
| Interpreter functions | exec          | ○                  |
| Interpreter functions | execute       | ○                  |

**Note:** There is a problem with the Compr pattern matching in the eval function and it does not fully pass OnlineTA
